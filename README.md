# Network Simulator with GUI in Java
## Overview:
This repository hosts a network simulator implemented in Java, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI). Designed primarily for educational purposes, the simulator allows users to explore various communication protocols by simulating the connection between two computers. Supported protocols include:

- Protocol Go Back N
- Protocol Parity
- Protocol Selective Repeat
- Protocol Sliding Window
- Protocol Stop and Wait
- Protocol Utopia
## Purpose:
The primary goal of this project is to provide an interactive platform for learning and experimentation with network protocols. By offering a GUI-based simulation environment, users can gain insights into the behaviors and characteristics of different protocols commonly used in networking scenarios.

## Features:
Graphical User Interface (GUI) for intuitive interaction.
Ability to start, stop, or pause transmissions within the simulation.
Real-time visualization of package transmission and reception.
Detailed package information display, including headers, data, and acknowledgment statuses.
Protocol selection functionality allowing users to choose and compare different protocols dynamically.
Extensible architecture supporting the addition of custom protocols or GUI enhancements.
## Usage:
To utilize the simulator, clone this repository and compile the Java source files. Run the simulator executable or launch the GUI application directly. Detailed instructions for navigating the GUI and configuring protocol parameters can be found in the documentation provided within the repository.
